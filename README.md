# Foodie

My family absolutely loves to go out to eat.  Usually there's a place we like and we want to remember it, a place we don't like and want to remember it, or places we want to go that we don't have time for so we want to remember those as well.

Foodie is an app where you can search for restaurants, and using the Google Places API, 20 results will come up for you to browse and add to three lists in your profile: Favorites, Want-To-Go's, and No-Go's.

In the future I am planning to:
* Make it mobile friendly
* Allow a user to add notes about individual restaurants
* Create a randomizer feature: a user chooses a food type, and based on that, a randomized option is presented to them
* Bring in reviews from Yelp or Google
* Allow a user to upload a profile picture
* Allow a user to share their lists to social media
